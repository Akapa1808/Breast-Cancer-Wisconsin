# Breast-Cancer-Wisconsin
Building Machine Learning Model to predict whether the cancer is benign or malignant on Breast Cancer Wisconsin Data Set.
# Step 1: Define Problem Statement
Our objective is to identify which features are most helpful in predicting malignant or benign cancer and to classify whether the breast cancer is benign or malignant.

## Step 2: Data Collection
## DATA OVERVIEW
I have used publically available dataset Breast Cancer Wisconsin and have download from UCI Machine Learning Repository. Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29 Attribute Information: 1) ID number 2) Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign) 3-32) Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus: a) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter) b) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values) c) perimeter d) area e) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths) f) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0) g) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour) h) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour) i) symmetry j) fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1) The mean, standard error and "worst" or largest (mean of the three largest values) of these features were computed for each image, resulting in 30 features. For instance, field 3 is Mean Radius, field 13 is Radius SE, field 23 is Worst Radius.

## Step 3: Cleaning the Data

## Check missing or Null data points

## Step 4: Data Analysis and Exploration
