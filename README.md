# Breast-Cancer-Wisconsin
### Building Machine Learning Model to predict whether the cancer is benign or malignant on Breast Cancer Wisconsin Data Set.
### This article is part of a series. Check out the full series: Part 1, Part 2, Part 3, Part 4
### Step 1: Define Problem Statement
#### Our objective is to identify which features are most helpful in predicting malignant or benign cancer and to classify whether the breast cancer is benign or malignant.

With this code and the associated articles, you are going to learn:

How to explore your data and find the hidde relationship between features using different kind of vusualization techniques?
How to extract meaningful significant features from the data using different kind of feature selection techniques.
Create multiple models from scratch in python. Train and evaluate it.
Apply different modeling techniques to The Wisconsin Cancer Data-set. Predict if a tumor is benign or malignant, based on selected different features.

The data comes from The Wisconsin Cancer Data-set.
This data was gathered by the University of Wisconsin Hospitals, Madison and by Dr. William H. Wolberg.
